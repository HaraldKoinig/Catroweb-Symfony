## Upload program
> 

Given the HTTP Request:

| Method | POST |
| --- | --- |
| Url | /pocketcode/api/upload/upload.json |
   
And the POST parameters:

| Name | Value |
| --- | --- |
| username | Catrobat |
| token | cccccccccc |
| fileChecksum | &lt;md5 checksum of file&gt; |
   
And a catrobat file is attached to the request
 
And the POST parameter "`fileChecksum`" contains the MD5 sum of the attached file
 
And we assume the next generated token will be "`rrrrrrrrrrr`"
 
When the Request is invoked
 
Then the returned json object will be:
```json
{
  "projectId": "1",
  "statusCode": 200,
  "answer": "Your project was uploaded successfully!",
  "token": "rrrrrrrrrrr",
  "preHeaderMessages": ""
}
```
