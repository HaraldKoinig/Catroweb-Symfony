## Upload program
> 

Given I have the HTTP Request:

| Method | POST |
| --- | --- |
| Url | /pocketcode/api/upload/upload.json |
   
And I use the POST parameters:

| Name | Value |
| --- | --- |
| username | Catrobat |
| token | cccccccccc |
| fileChecksum | &lt;md5 checksum of file&gt; |
   
And I attach a catrobat file
 
And the POST parameter &quot;`fileChecksum`&quot; contains the MD5 sum of the given file
 
And We assume the next generated token will be &quot;`rrrrrrrrrrr`&quot;
 
When I invoke the Request
 
Then I will get the json object:
```json
{
  "projectId": "1",
  "statusCode": 200,
  "answer": "Your project was uploaded successfully!",
  "token": "rrrrrrrrrrr",
  "preHeaderMessages": ""
}
```
